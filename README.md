# The Automotive Collection
A collection of automotive OSS projects which may help you in the automotive context!

> To stop reinventing the wheel you need to know about the wheel. This list is an attempt to show the variety of open and free software for automotive, which could be useful in professional automotive development.

Your contribution is necessary to keep this list alive, increase the quality and to expand it. You can read more about it's origin and how you can participate in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
